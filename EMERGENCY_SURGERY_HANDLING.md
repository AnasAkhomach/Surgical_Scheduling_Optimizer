## Conflict Resolution Strategies

### 1. Bump Lower Priority
- **When:** Emergency has higher priority than scheduled surgery
- **Action:** Reschedule lower priority surgery to later time
- **Impact:** Moderate disruption to affected patients

### 2. Use Backup Room
- **When:** Alternative operating rooms are available
- **Action:** Assign emergency to backup room
- **Impact:** Minimal disruption to existing schedule

### 3. Extend Hours
- **When:** Emergency can be scheduled in overtime
- **Action:** Schedule during extended operating hours
- **Impact:** Additional staffing costs, overtime pay

### 4. Manual Review

## Usage Examples

### Basic Emergency Insertion
```python
from emergency_surgery_handler import EmergencySurgeryHandler
from api.models import EmergencySurgeryRequest, EmergencyType, EmergencyPriority

# Create request
request = EmergencySurgeryRequest(
    patient_id=1,
    surgery_type_id=1,
    emergency_type=EmergencyType.TRAUMA,
    emergency_priority=EmergencyPriority.URGENT,
    duration_minutes=90,
    arrival_time=datetime.now()
)

# Process emergency
handler = EmergencySurgeryHandler(db_session)
result = handler.insert_emergency_surgery(request)

if result.success:
    print(f"Emergency surgery {result.emergency_surgery_id} scheduled successfully")
    print(f"Wait time: {result.wait_time_minutes} minutes")
    print(f"Disruption score: {result.schedule_disruption_score}")
```

### Emergency Metrics Analysis
```python
# Get emergency metrics for the month
metrics = handler.get_emergency_metrics(
    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),
    end_date=datetime(2024, 1, 31)
)

print(f"Total emergencies: {metrics.total_emergencies}")
print(f"Average wait time: {metrics.average_wait_time_minutes} minutes")
print(f"Success rate: {metrics.successful_insertions_rate * 100}%")
```

## Configuration

### Priority Weights
```python
priority_weights = {
    EmergencyPriority.IMMEDIATE: 1.0,
    EmergencyPriority.URGENT: 0.8,
    EmergencyPriority.SEMI_URGENT: 0.6,
    EmergencyPriority.SCHEDULED: 0.4
}
```

### Maximum Wait Times
```python
max_wait_times = {
    EmergencyPriority.IMMEDIATE: 15,    # 15 minutes
    EmergencyPriority.URGENT: 60,       # 1 hour
    EmergencyPriority.SEMI_URGENT: 240, # 4 hours
    EmergencyPriority.SCHEDULED: 1440   # 24 hours
}
```

## Future Enhancements
