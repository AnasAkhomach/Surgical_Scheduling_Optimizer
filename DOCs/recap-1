Okay, let's recap our progress on the tabu_optimizer project and outline the next steps based on our work and the provided design documents.

Project Recap: Tabu Search Optimizer for Surgery Scheduling

Over our sessions, we've focused on building and refining a Tabu Search based optimizer for surgery scheduling. Here's a summary of what we've accomplished:

1. Core Tabu Search Algorithm Implementation:

   - TabuList ( `tabu_list.py` ): We implemented a robust TabuList class. This included:
     - Dynamic and adaptive tenure mechanisms: update_tenure_randomly , adjust_tenure_by_frequency , adjust_tenure_by_search_progress .
     - Consistent handling and formatting of tabu attributes for various move types.
     - Detailed docstrings and logging.
   - TabuSearchCore ( `tabu_search_core.py` ): This class orchestrates the Tabu Search.
     - Correct initialization and integration of the TabuList .
     - Implementation of the main search loop: neighbor selection, solution evaluation, tabu status checking, aspiration criteria, and adding moves to the tabu list.
     - Incorporation of adaptive tenure methods.
     - Standard termination conditions (max iterations, iterations without improvement, time limit).
2. Objective Function Enhancement ( SolutionEvaluator in `solution_evaluator.py` ):

   - We significantly refined the objective function to capture critical scheduling goals.
   - Introduced configurable weights for components like: OR utilization, staff overtime, surgeon preferences, workload balance, patient wait time, emergency surgery priority, and operational costs.
   - Implemented detailed scoring logic for these components.
   - Integrated PreferenceSatisfactionCalculator (from `preference_satisfaction_calculator.py` ) and WorkloadBalanceCalculator (from `workload_balance_calculator.py` ) after ensuring they correctly process SurgeryRoomAssignment objects and interact with database models (like SurgeonPreference from `models.py` ).
3. Neighborhood Strategies Refinement ( NeighborhoodStrategies in `neighborhood_strategies.py` ):

   - We enhanced several neighborhood generation strategies to improve their effectiveness and ensure they work with SurgeryRoomAssignment model instances:
     - Move Surgery to a Different Room: Tries original start time, then a default early slot. Tabu: ("move_surgery_room", surgery_id, new_room_id, new_start_time_isoformat) .
     - Swap Two Surgeries: Correctly handles surgery durations and uses itertools.combinations for efficiency. Tabu: ("swap_surgeries", frozenset({s1_id, s2_id}), s1_new_room, s1_new_start, s2_new_room, s2_new_start) .
     - Shift Surgery Time: Ensures shifts are within operational windows. Tabu: ("shift_time", surgery_id, room_id, new_start_time_isoformat) .
     - Change Surgeon: Selects alternative qualified surgeons. Tabu: ("change_surgeon", surgery_id, new_surgeon_id) .
   - Standardized tabu attribute formats for better tracking.
4. Feasibility Checking ( FeasibilityChecker in `feasibility_checker.py` ):

   - This was a major focus recently. We enhanced methods to ensure robust validation of schedules:
     - is_surgeon_available : Checks against current schedule and DB.
     - is_equipment_available : Checks inventory and concurrent usage (in-memory and DB).
     - is_room_available : Checks for room conflicts (in-memory and DB).
     - is_feasible : The main method now uses the above helpers to validate each assignment in a proposed schedule, considering SurgeryRoomAssignment objects.
   - Integrated the FeasibilityChecker into TabuSearchCore so that neighbors are checked for feasibility before evaluation, improving efficiency.
5. Model Instance Consistency:

   - A recurring theme was ensuring all components consistently handle SurgeryRoomAssignment model instances rather than dictionaries, resolving potential AttributeError issues and improving data integrity.
6. Integration and Orchestration ( TabuSearchScheduler in `scheduling_optimizer.py` ):

   - Updated this main scheduler class to correctly instantiate and pass all necessary components (like the enhanced FeasibilityChecker ) to TabuSearchCore .
Project Status & Next Steps (Based on DOCs in `DOCs` ):

Based on the `Audit.txt` , `algo-core.txt` , `SRD.txt` , `SDD.txt` , and their updates (e.g., `SDD Updates Based on the _Optimizing Surgery Scheduling with SDST using Tabu Search_ Report_.md` ), here's what's built and what's next:

What We Have Built (Alignment with Docs):

- Core Tabu Search Framework: The foundational elements of Tabu Search are largely in place ( `tabu_list.py` , `tabu_search_core.py` , parts of `scheduling_optimizer.py` ). This aligns with `Tabu-Algo-Desc.txt` and `Audit.txt` which noted the initial structure.
- Objective Function ( evaluate_solution ): Significantly developed beyond a placeholder, incorporating multiple criteria as suggested by the audit and design docs. It now considers OR utilization, staff overtime, surgeon preferences, workload balance, patient wait time, and emergency priority.
- Feasibility Checks ( is_feasible , etc.): These are no longer placeholders. The FeasibilityChecker is now robust, checking surgeon, equipment, and room availability against both in-memory and database states, as recommended by the audit.
- Neighborhood Generation ( generate_neighbor_solutions ): We've expanded beyond the initial single move type. While more can be added, the current strategies are more diverse.
- Database Models ( `models.py` ): These were established early and seem well-defined, supporting resource management (FR-SCOPE-002 from `SRD.txt` ).
- Handling of SurgeryRoomAssignment objects: Consistent use of these model instances across components is a major step forward.
What Still Needs to Be Built or Enhanced (Next Session Focus):

1. Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST): This is a CRITICAL missing piece highlighted in `SDD Updates Based on the _Optimizing Surgery Scheduling with SDST using Tabu Search_ Report_.md` and `algo-core.txt` .

   - Data Model: Ensure SurgeryTypes and a SequenceDependentSetupTimes table/matrix are fully defined in `models.py` and can be loaded/queried (as per SDD Section 5.2, 9.1.1).
   - Objective Function: Modify SolutionEvaluator to accurately calculate and incorporate SDST into the total schedule cost/makespan.
   - Neighborhood Strategies: All move evaluations within NeighborhoodStrategies must consider the impact of SDST when calculating the start/end times of affected surgeries.
   - Feasibility Checker: SDST might affect the end times of surgeries, so FeasibilityChecker needs to use SDST-aware end times for its checks.
   - Initial Solution Generation: SchedulerUtils.initialize_solution should consider SDST when placing initial surgeries.
2. Refine Aspiration Criteria in TabuSearchCore :

   - The current aspiration criterion ( score > best_score ) is common but could be expanded based on `algo-core.txt` if more sophisticated strategies are desired (e.g., aspiration by objective components).
3. Intensification and Diversification Strategies in TabuSearchCore :

   - These are mentioned in `Audit.txt` as not evident. Consider implementing strategies if the search gets stuck in local optima (e.g., restarting from a perturbed solution for diversification, or focusing search in promising regions for intensification).
4. Comprehensive Testing:

   - Unit Tests: For all new logic, especially SDST calculations, feasibility checks with SDST, and objective function components related to SDST.
   - Integration Tests: Test the entire TabuSearchScheduler flow with SDST incorporated.
   - Update existing test files ( `test_objective_function.py` , `test_enhanced_objective_function.py` , etc.) to reflect new functionalities.
5. Database Integration for SDST:

   - Ensure _load_initial_data in TabuSearchScheduler can load SDST data (e.g., from a SequenceDependentSetupTimes table).
   - The services layer might need new services or updates to handle SDST data if it's complex.
6. Operational Cost Calculation:

   - The OperationalCostCalculator in `operational_cost_calculator.py` is referenced as a placeholder in SolutionEvaluator . This needs full implementation if operational costs are a key part of the objective.
7. Parameter Tuning Strategy:

   - As noted in `SDD Updates Based on the _Optimizing Surgery Scheduling with SDST using Tabu Search_ Report_.md` (Section IV.A), once the core logic with SDST is stable, a strategy for tuning Tabu Search parameters (tenure, iteration counts, weights) will be important.
8. Broader SRD/SDD Features:

   - While our focus has been the core optimizer, the documents mention UI, API, reporting, notifications, EHR integration, etc. These are likely outside the scope of our immediate backend work but are long-term goals for the project.
Priority for Next Session:

The highest priority for the next session should be the full integration of Sequence-Dependent Setup Times (SDST) across all relevant components: data models, initial solution generation, neighborhood strategies, feasibility checking, and the objective function. This is a fundamental requirement from the design documents and significantly impacts schedule quality.

This concludes our current work. The project has made substantial progress, and the foundation for a powerful Tabu Search optimizer is well-established.
