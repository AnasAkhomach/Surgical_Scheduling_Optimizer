let us start from this analysis i did when running the app and watching the consloe logs {{Log Summary (Batch 1):

The application initiated by checking for an authentication token in localStorage, but no token was found (üîë Token from localStorage: null, ‚ùå No token found in localStorage).

A login attempt was made via a POST request to http://localhost:8000/api/auth/token. This request was successful (üì• Response: 200 OK), returning an access token (‚úÖ API Success: {access_token: 'eyJhbG...', token_type: 'bearer'}). However, a warning was issued for a slow API response, as this token request took 779.90ms, exceeding the 200ms threshold (‚ö†Ô∏è Slow API response: /auth/token took 779.90ms).

The received token was then successfully stored in localStorage (üîë Storing token in localStorage: eyJhbG..., ‚úÖ Token stored in localStorage, ‚úÖ Token storage verified).

Following the successful login and token storage, the application proceeded to fetch user data. The stored token was retrieved (üîë Token from localStorage: eyJhbG...) and an Authorization header was added. A GET request was made to http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me. This request was also successful and fast (üì• Response: 200 OK (7.60ms)), returning user details including username ('admin205'), email, full name, and role (‚úÖ API Success: {username: 'admin205', email: 'admin205@email.com', ...}).

Finally, the DashboardScreen.vue component mounted and indicated it was loading data (DashboardScreen.vue:479 DashboardScreen mounted. Loading data...).

Key Information Retained:

Initial state: No token.
Successful login and token acquisition.
Performance Warning: Slow response for the /auth/token endpoint.
Successful storage of the token.
Successful fetching of user data after login.
Dashboard component mounting.

Log Summary (Batch 2):

The SchedulingScreen.vue component reported issues related to data availability for its Gantt chart:

It repeatedly logged: SchedulingScreen.vue:598 No operating rooms defined in store. Gantt chart rows will be empty. This indicates that the necessary data for operating rooms was not available in the application's state management (store) when the Gantt chart component attempted to render or update.
To populate the scheduling data, several API requests were initiated:

GET http://localhost:8000/api/current?date=2023-10-27: This request was successful (üì• Response: 200 OK (13.10ms)) but returned an empty array (‚úÖ API Success: []), suggesting no current items for the specified date.
GET http://localhost:8000/api/operating-rooms: Successfully fetched 80 operating rooms (üì• Response: 200 OK (25.90ms)).
GET http://localhost:8000/api/staff: Successfully fetched 31 staff members (üì• Response: 200 OK (34.80ms)).
GET http://localhost:8000/api/surgery-types: Successfully fetched 14 surgery types (‚úÖ API Success: (14) [...]). However, this request was flagged with a performance warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è Slow API response: /surgery-types took 315.70ms (>200ms threshold).
Critical Error Encountered:

The request to GET http://localhost:8000/api/equipment failed critically.
A CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) error occurred: Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/' ... has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present.... This means the server at localhost:8000 did not permit the frontend at localhost:5173 to access this resource.
This was accompanied by a network error net::ERR_FAILED and a 500 (Internal Server Error) status for the http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/ endpoint.
The application logged this as üí• API request failed: /equipment TypeError: Failed to fetch and Data load failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch.
Consequences of the Error:

Due to the failure in fetching equipment data, subsequent messages appeared:
SchedulingScreen.vue:902 Operating rooms might still be loading or are empty.
The message No operating rooms defined in store. Gantt chart rows will be empty. was logged again, suggesting the incomplete data loading affected the Gantt chart's ability to display correctly, even if operating room data itself was fetched successfully earlier (the overall data dependency might be the issue).
Key Information Retained:

Persistent issue on SchedulingScreen with Gantt chart rows being empty due to missing operating room data in the store.
Successful fetching of /current (empty data), /operating-rooms, and /staff.
Performance Warning: Slow response for /surgery-types endpoint.
Critical CORS error and 500 Internal Server Error for /api/equipment request, leading to a "Failed to fetch" error.
This failure impacted overall data loading for the scheduling screen.

Log Summary (Batch 3):

This batch of logs points to a failure within an optimization feature, likely related to surgical scheduling.

Two similar error messages were logged:

main.js:27 Optimization failed: Error: No surgeries found for optimization
main.js:27 Quick optimization failed: Error: No surgeries found for optimization
Both errors indicate that the optimization process could not run because it did not have any surgery data to work with.

The failure originated in the runOptimization function within optimizationStore.js (line 99).

This process was triggered by an action named runQuickOptimization in the OptimizationSuggestions.vue component (line 108), which appears to be linked to a user interface element (e.g., a button click).

Key Information Retained:

An "Optimization" or "Quick Optimization" feature is present in the application.
This feature failed because no surgeries were available for it to process.
The error was caught and logged within the application's error handling (main.js, optimizationStore.js, OptimizationSuggestions.vue).

Log Summary (Batch 4) Resource Management Data Loading Resource Management Data Loading
The application proceeded to load data for resource management:

Operating Rooms Data:

A GET request was made to http://localhost:8000/api/operating-rooms after retrieving the authentication token.
The request was successful (üì• Response: 200 OK), and 80 operating rooms were fetched (‚úÖ API Success: (80) [...]).
A confirmation message Operating rooms loaded successfully: 80 was logged from resourceStore.js.
Notably, a performance warning ‚ö†Ô∏è was issued: Slow API response: /operating-rooms took 339.30ms (>200ms threshold).
Staff Data:

Following this, a GET request was made to http://localhost:8000/api/staff, again with the necessary authorization.
This request was also successful (üì• Response: 200 OK) and completed quickly (30.00ms).
31 staff members were fetched (‚úÖ API Success: (31) [...]).
A confirmation Staff loaded successfully: 31 was logged from resourceStore.js.
Key Information Retained:

Successful loading of 80 operating rooms and 31 staff members for a resource management context (indicated by resourceStore.js and ResourceManagementScreen.vue).
Performance Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è: The API call to fetch operating rooms was slower than the 200ms threshold.

Log Summary (Batch 5) - Master Schedule & Dashboard Data Loading, Recurring Equipment Fetch Failure
This batch shows activity primarily within the MasterScheduleScreen.vue and DashboardScreen.vue, both of which appear to rely on a GanttChart.vue component and a shared scheduleStore.js for data.

Key Observations:

Initial Screen Loading:

MasterScheduleScreen.vue:126 MasterScheduleScreen mounted. Loading schedule data...
Later, DashboardScreen.vue:479 DashboardScreen mounted. Loading data... appears, indicating navigation or component loading.
Repeated API Request Cycles:

Throughout the logs, there's a recurring pattern of multiple GET requests being made to fetch essential data:
http://localhost:8000/api/current?date=2023-10-27
http://localhost:8000/api/operating-rooms
http://localhost:8000/api/staff
http://localhost:8000/api/equipment
http://localhost:8000/api/surgery-types
These cycles of requests are initiated multiple times, often triggered by the GanttChart.vue (via scheduleStore.js's loadInitialData function) and also directly by MasterScheduleScreen.vue.
Successful Data Fetching (for most resources):

Requests to /current?date=2023-10-27 consistently return 200 OK, sometimes with an empty array [] and sometimes with an array of 14 items.
Requests to /operating-rooms successfully return 200 OK with 80 items.
Requests to /staff successfully return 200 OK with 31 items.
Requests to /surgery-types successfully return 200 OK, sometimes with an empty array [] and sometimes with 14 items.
Response times for these successful requests are generally good, with no "Slow API response" warnings in this specific batch.
CRITICAL & RECURRING ERROR - Equipment Fetch Failure:

The most significant and frequently repeated issue is the failure of all attempts to GET http://localhost:8000/api/equipment.
Each attempt results in the same sequence of errors seen in Batch 2:
CORS Policy Error: Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/' ... has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present... (This error appears with origins master-schedule:1 and dashboard:1, corresponding to the active screen).
Network Error & Server Error: GET http://localhost:8000/api/equipment/ net::ERR_FAILED 500 (Internal Server Error).
Application Level Errors:
main.js:27 üí• API request failed: /equipment TypeError: Failed to fetch
main.js:27 Data load failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch
The call stacks consistently show these errors originate from scheduleStore.js (loadInitialData), called by GanttChart.vue and MasterScheduleScreen.vue, and also affect the DashboardScreen.vue.
Key Information Retained:

Both MasterScheduleScreen and DashboardScreen are attempting to load schedule data, heavily involving the GanttChart component.
Data for current schedules, operating-rooms, staff, and surgery-types is being fetched successfully, though the content for current and surgery-types varies (sometimes empty).
The critical failure to fetch /api/equipment due to CORS and a 500 Internal Server Error is persistent and occurs repeatedly whenever these screens or their components (like the Gantt chart) try to load initial data.
This error suggests a fundamental problem with either the /api/equipment endpoint on the server or the server's CORS configuration for this specific endpoint. The repetition indicates the application retries or re-requests this data at various points but consistently fails.
