1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to specify the software requirements for the Surgery Scheduling System App. This system is designed to manage and optimize the scheduling of elective and emergency surgical operations within a hospital or clinic setting. The primary goals are to improve operating room (OR) utilization, reduce patient waiting times, enhance resource management (surgeons, staff, equipment), and provide a robust decision-support tool for schedulers. This system is being developed as part of a final thesis project to demonstrate the application of optimization techniques in healthcare logistics.

1.2 Document Conventions
This document uses the following conventions:

Requirements are uniquely identified with a prefix indicating their type (e.g., FR- for Functional Requirement, NFR- for Non-Functional Requirement) followed by a three-letter code for the category and a number (e.g., FR-SCHED-001).
The keywords "shall," "must," "should," "may," and "can" are used as defined in RFC 2119 (IETF). "Shall" indicates a mandatory requirement. "Should" indicates a recommended feature. "May" indicates an optional feature.
Priority levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low) may be assigned to requirements to guide development focus. (We can add these later if you wish).
1.3 Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
The intended audience for this document includes:

The student developing the project (yourself).
The thesis supervisor and any academic reviewers.
Potentially, hospital administrators or staff who might evaluate or provide feedback on the system's concepts. Readers should familiarize themselves with the overall project goals in Section 1.4 (Project Scope) and Section 2 (Overall Description) before diving into the specific requirements in Sections 3, 4, and 5.
1.4 Project Scope

1.4.1 In Scope:
The Surgery Scheduling System App shall:

FR-SCOPE-001: Support the scheduling of both elective and emergency surgeries.
FR-SCOPE-002: Manage key resources including surgeons, operating rooms (ORs), specialized nursing staff, anesthesiologists, and critical surgical equipment.
FR-SCOPE-003: Provide role-based access control for different user types (e.g., Schedulers, Surgeons, Nurses, Administrators).
FR-SCOPE-004: Implement advanced optimization algorithms (e.g., inspired by heuristic methods like Tabu Search, as explored in the design phase) to generate efficient and conflict-minimized schedules.
FR-SCOPE-005: Allow for manual adjustments and overrides to the optimized schedule by authorized personnel.
FR-SCOPE-006: Integrate with existing hospital Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems via a defined API to retrieve necessary patient data and potentially update schedules (read-only for patient data initially, with clear data mapping for integration).
FR-SCOPE-007: Generate reports on OR utilization, surgeon workload, patient wait times, and other key performance indicators.
FR-SCOPE-008: Provide a notification system for schedule changes, confirmations, and alerts.
FR-SCOPE-009: Be designed for on-premises deployment within a hospital's IT infrastructure.
FR-SCOPE-010: Maintain an audit trail of significant system events and data modifications.
1.4.2 Out of Scope:
The following features and functionalities are considered out of scope for the initial version of this thesis project:

Full Electronic Medical Record (EMR) or Electronic Health Record (EHR) functionalities (the system will integrate with, not replace, existing EHRs).
Medical billing and insurance processing.
Direct patient interface for self-scheduling or viewing detailed medical records.
Pharmacy and inventory management beyond critical surgical equipment.
Advanced diagnostic AI or clinical decision support beyond scheduling optimization.
Management of post-operative care logistics beyond basic discharge status updates relevant to OR turnover.
Mobile application development beyond responsive web design for existing browsers.

2. Overall Description

2.1 Product Perspective
The Surgery Scheduling System App is a new software product intended to replace or significantly augment manual or less optimized surgery scheduling processes currently used in many healthcare facilities. It will function as a specialized decision-support and operational management tool. While designed to operate independently for its core scheduling functions, it is envisioned as a component within a larger hospital information ecosystem, capable of interfacing with existing systems such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs). For this thesis project, the system demonstrates a practical application of optimization algorithms to a real-world complex problem.

2.2 Product Features (Summary)
The system will provide the following key features:

Dynamic Surgery Scheduling: Creation, modification, and cancellation of elective and emergency surgeries.
Optimization Engine: Algorithmic generation of optimized schedules considering various constraints and objectives.
Resource Management: Tracking and allocation of operating rooms, surgeons, staff, and equipment.
Emergency Integration: Efficient incorporation of urgent cases into the existing schedule.
User Role Management: Differentiated access and functionalities based on user roles.
Reporting & Analytics: Generation of insightful reports for operational efficiency and decision-making.
Notifications & Alerts: Timely communication of schedule updates and critical events.
EHR Integration Support: Interface for data exchange with EHR systems.
Audit Trails: Logging of important system activities for security and accountability.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

User Class	Characteristics	Primary Responsibilities/Needs within the System	Technical Expertise
Scheduler / OR Manager	Hospital staff responsible for daily OR scheduling and resource coordination. Requires comprehensive system control.	Create, view, modify, and cancel surgeries. Optimize schedules. Manage resources (ORs, staff blocks). Handle conflicts and emergency insertions. Generate reports on OR utilization and efficiency.	Medium (proficient with office software, potentially some scheduling systems)
Surgeon	Medical doctors performing surgeries. Need clear visibility of their schedule and ability to provide input.	View personal surgery schedule. Indicate availability, block off times. Review patient details relevant to scheduled surgeries (via EHR link if possible). May provide preferences for ORs/equipment/staff.	Low to Medium
Nurse / Medical Staff (e.g., Anesthetist, OR Nurse)	Clinical staff involved in surgeries. Need to know their assignments and patient details.	View assigned surgery schedules. Acknowledge assignments. Access patient information relevant to their role for a specific surgery. Update status of specific tasks (e.g., OR preparation, patient ready).	Low to Medium
System Administrator	IT personnel responsible for system maintenance, user account management, and ensuring system uptime.	Manage user accounts and permissions. Monitor system performance. Perform backups and recovery. Manage system configurations and integrations. Troubleshoot technical issues.	High
