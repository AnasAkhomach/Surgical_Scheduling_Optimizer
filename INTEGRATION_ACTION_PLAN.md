## Current Status: EXECUTING
**Last Updated:** 2024-12-19
**Current Phase:** Model Data Structure Fixes

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

- ‚úÖ All required fields present and properly formatted
- ‚úÖ Frontend compatibility confirmed

**Files Modified:**
- `api/models.py` - Updated `OperatingRoom` class
- `verify_operating_rooms_fix.py` - Created verification script

#### 2. Multiple Model Fixes Applied (COMPLETED)
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- Updated `Staff` model: Replaced `__init__` with `model_post_init` for `staff_id` ‚Üí `id` mapping
- Updated `Surgery` model: Added `id` field and `model_post_init` for `surgery_id` ‚Üí `id` mapping
- Updated `Appointment` model: Added `id` field and `model_post_init` for `appointment_id` ‚Üí `id` mapping
- All models now use consistent `model_post_init` pattern for reliable field mapping

**Files Modified:**
- `api/models.py` - Updated `Surgeon`, `Staff`, `Surgery`, `Appointment` classes
- `test_all_models_fix.py` - Created comprehensive verification script

#### 1. Critical Data Structure Mismatch in Operating Room Management - RESOLVED

**Issue Identified:**
- Backend `OperatingRoom` model missing required fields (`name`, `status`, `primary_service`)
- Frontend expecting `id` field but backend only providing `room_id`
- Pydantic model validation failures
- Database schema inconsistencies

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Database Schema Fix** ‚úÖ
   - Added missing columns to `operatingroom` table:
     - `name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL DEFAULT "Operating Room"
     - `status` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT "Active"
     - `primary_service` VARCHAR(255) NULL
   - Updated existing records with default values
   - File: `fix_operatingroom_schema.py`

2. **Pydantic Model Updates** ‚úÖ
   - Updated `OperatingRoomBase` model configuration:
     - Added `model_config = ConfigDict(from_attributes=True, populate_by_name=True)`
   - Fixed `OperatingRoom` response model:
     - Made `id` field optional with proper mapping from `room_id`
     - Added `model_post_init` method for field computation
     - Ensured default values for missing database fields
   - File: `api/models.py`

3. **API Endpoint Verification** ‚úÖ
   - Confirmed `/api/operating-rooms` endpoint returns 200 OK
   - Verified authentication flow works correctly
   - Tested field mapping and data structure

**Technical Implementation Details:**

```python
# Updated OperatingRoom model with proper field mapping
class OperatingRoom(OperatingRoomBase):
    room_id: int = Field(alias="roomId")
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, alias="id")

    def model_post_init(self, __context) -> None:
        # Map room_id to id for frontend compatibility
        if self.id is None and self.room_id is not None:
            self.id = self.room_id
        # Set default values for missing fields
        if not self.name:
            self.name = f"OR {self.room_id or 'Unknown'}"
        if not self.status:
            self.status = "Active"
```

**Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ Health endpoint: 200 OK
- ‚úÖ User registration: 201 Created
- ‚úÖ Authentication: 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Operating rooms endpoint: 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Field mapping working correctly
- ‚úÖ Required fields present in response

### üéØ CURRENT PRIORITY TASKS

#### 3. Frontend Integration Testing (READY)
**Status:** üîÑ READY_FOR_EXECUTION
**AI Assessment:** All backend model fixes completed, ready for comprehensive frontend testing
**Proposed Action:**
- Test all fixed APIs (operating rooms, surgeries, staff, appointments) with frontend
- Verify data transformation and field mapping across all models
- Validate CRUD operations through frontend interface
- Test end-to-end user workflows
- Document integration success and any remaining issues

#### 4. Database Stability Issues (IDENTIFIED)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKING
**AI Assessment:** Server crashes when accessing certain endpoints, needs investigation
**Proposed Action:**
- Investigate server crashes during API testing
- Check database schema consistency
- Verify all foreign key relationships
- Ensure proper error handling in API endpoints
- Stabilize backend before comprehensive testing

### Next Priority Tasks üéØ

#### 5. API Authentication and Trailing Slash Issues (EXECUTING)
**Status:** üîÑ EXECUTING
**AI Assessment:** API server logs show widespread 401 Unauthorized errors and 307 Temporary Redirects for endpoints accessed without a trailing slash. Investigation revealed that the `/api/equipment/` endpoint was missing authentication. Additionally, several routers defined base routes (e.g., GET /) with explicit trailing slashes, causing redirects when accessed without them. The 401s on redirected, authenticated requests might be due to clients not re-sending auth headers correctly.
**Actions Taken & Proposed Action:**
- **Secured Endpoints:** Added `Depends(get_current_active_user)` to all routes in `api/routers/equipment.py`.
- **Standardized Trailing Slashes:** Modified route definitions in `api/routers/equipment.py` and `api/routers/operating_rooms.py` to remove trailing slashes from base paths (e.g., changed `@router.get("/")` to `@router.get("")`). This should reduce 307 redirects.
- **Further Investigation (If Needed):** If 401s persist on authenticated routes even after minimizing redirects, further analysis of client-side `Authorization` header handling on 307s will be required. For now, the primary suspected causes (missing auth on one router, frequent redirects) have been addressed.
- **Testing:** Test all modified endpoints (`equipment`, `operating-rooms`) for correct authentication behavior and absence of 307 redirects for base paths. Specifically test `/api/schedules/optimize` again.
- **Apply Pattern:** Apply trailing slash standardization to other routers as needed.
